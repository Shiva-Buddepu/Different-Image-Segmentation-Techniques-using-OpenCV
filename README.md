# Different-Image-Segmentation-Techniques-using-OpenCV
This project explores various image segmentation techniques using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. Image segmentation is a crucial process in computer vision, where an image is partitioned into multiple segments or regions to simplify or change the representation of the image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze.
